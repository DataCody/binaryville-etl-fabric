# Real-World Project Case Study
## Introduction to the Problem

Our client, Binaryville, is a multinational retailer operating in 27 countries, with over 11,000 stores and a strong e-commerce presence. Because they generate enormous amounts of data daily, they face challenges in consolidating and analyzing it efficiently, which leads to missed business opportunities and operational inefficiencies.

## Business Need

Binaryville requires a solution that can:

Consolidate data from both in-store and online channels across multiple countries.
Process vast amounts of historical and real-time transactional data.
Enable accurate, company-wide analytics to drive better decision-making.
Scale to meet future growth and potential acquisitions.
## Data Sources

We will work with three key data sources:

Customer data: CSV files from their CRM system, updated daily (500 million records)
Product catalog: JSON files from their inventory management system (one million SKUs)
Transaction history: Parquet files from POS and e-commerce platforms (10 billion transactions annually)
## Expected Outcomes

The implementation of this solution aims to:

Reduce data processing time from 72 hours to under 6 hours.
Increase inventory forecasting accuracy by 25%.
Boost customer personalization efforts, leading to a 15% increase in repeat purchases.
Enable real-time financial reporting across all regions.
## Challenges

Key challenges include:

Poor data quality, especially in older records and data from recent acquisitions
Variations in data formats and schemas across regions
Processing and analyzing 5 years of historical data alongside daily updates
Complex ETL processes due to differing currencies, time zones, and regional product codes
Minimizing disruptions to existing operations during implementation
## Solution Approach Using Microsoft Fabric

We will implement a data lakehouse architecture using Microsoft Fabric to address these challenges. Here's how:

### 1. Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer):

Set up automated daily ingestion of CSV, JSON, and Parquet files into the Bronze Layer of Microsoft Fabric’s Lakehouse.
Use Fabric Pipelines to automate ingestion processes.
### 2. Data Processing (Silver Layer):

Clean and standardize data using Microsoft Fabric Dataflows, addressing data quality issues.
Normalize data across regions (such as currency conversion, time zone alignment) using Fabric Transformation Activities.
Leverage Delta Lake features in Fabric for ACID transactions and schema evolution.
### 3. Data Modeling (Gold Layer):

Create a unified customer view across all regions using Fabric's Power BI Data Model.
Standardize product categorization and develop aggregated sales and inventory models.
### 4. Batch Processing:

Design efficient Spark jobs within Microsoft Fabric’s Spark Engine for processing daily incremental loads.
### 5. Analytics and Reporting:

Connect Power BI to Microsoft Fabric to create real-time dashboards for different business units (sales, finance, inventory, marketing).
